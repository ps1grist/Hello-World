# Hello-World

Hello friends.

I am not a programmer. Not a coder. Not a script kiddie. And yet.

Since BASIC on the ZX Spectrum and the unexpected discovery of Visual Basic in Windows 95 applications like Excel. Since Prolog at university, HTML and CSS as an increasingly relevant part of my (*anyone's*) day job. Since recently choosing to change the direction of my work towards a more technical niche and my completion of the Python for Everyone (yes, entry-level) course by Chuck Severance at the University of Michigan in three days, I've realised.

I can't do it by myself.

And so here I am, world.

Thank you in advance for your patience, forbearance and for not smirking at the back.

Peter
